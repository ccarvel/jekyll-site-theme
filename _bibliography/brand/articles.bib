Ultimately, Brand’s work has allowed my own participation in this call and response due to its role as the connective tissue in my own reading practice.},

A Map asks us how we find each other, how the wounds and hauntings that stand between us overdetermine our movement, desire, and flesh, and how we still then find each other. But once we do find each other, how do we find touch? What kind of “way finding” leads us past brutality and into the kind of touch we desire? In this reflection, I try to track touch within Brand’s Map by lingering in the passages where it appears and disappears. I track touch to reflect on my own map, to illuminate an essential aspect of the rupture with which this work is concerned, and to think generatively about how we attend to this intersection of the personal and the political.},

	abstract = {This paper explores Dionne Brand‘s A Map to the Door of No Return: Notes to Belonging (2011) as a non-traditional archive, yet idealistically a poetic narrative map, beginning epically at the Door of No Return on the west coast of Africa and spreading out infinitely. I argue the main focus is freedom as marronage mapped out through a set of hyperlinked tension-filled stories across time and space that collectively connect geography and/to history; its method is collecting and recording “conversations” (224), both spoken and observed, about Black diasporic lives and encounters across time and space. In Map Brand’s desire for freedom leads her to interrogate and challenge selected old world maps, charts journeys, and, in narrative and poetry, re/call and re/invent the past and actively re/imagine the present and future of new world liberated Black people as self-created individuals. The result is a modern literary artifact: as memorial to the marooned, with a ruttier for freedom for the marooned. This work forms part of a neo-archive of Black Diasporic texts that collectively perform reparative story-telling. Brand maps and builds a different (non-traditional) repository by recording selected experiences of Black people in the New World Diaspora—connecting paths forged from “a place emptied of beginnings” (6). Map charts the points on a journey to a liberatory future, one based on, as Brand describes it, “a life of conversations about a forgotten list of irretrievable selves” (224)—human dignity. Brand’s Map, then, for inspiration, preserves selected histories that might have otherwise remained unexplored. It makes future retrieval possible, and the possibility of forgetting impossible—and ultimately this is the ageless beauty of this provocative work.},

By analyzing the Calgary Stampede as a case study of forms of white masculinity that are supported, encouraged, prioritized and, at times, glorified in Alberta, the authors demonstrate how this transient white guy problem is proving exceedingly dangerous to many Indigenous women in particular (as well as to women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA people more broadly) and diverse local communities, the land and the environment. Their analysis aims to unpack how settler-colonial logics of extractivism and cultural practices of placemaking, too often viewed as innocuous and as central to an Albertan identity, come to be deeply implicated in ongoing violence against Indigenous women.},

In this article I analyze news frames that circulated in Englishlanguage Canadian news outlets throughout 2020, performing an informal discourse analysis of coverage of Quebec’s secularism law, Bill 21, alongside coverage of two anti-mask protests held in Aylmer, Ontario. In the case of Bill 21, I argue that the predominant frame that shaped coverage was one of hypocrisy, which foregrounded the discriminatory nature of the legislation but obscured the Christian cultural politics otherwise embedded in the law. In the case of the Aylmer marches, I argue that news coverage centered on the role of the religious outlier, particularly through attention to outspoken Church of God Restoration pastor Rev. Henry Hildebrandt. This frame amplified Hildebrandt’s political statements but downplayed the more quotidian role of conservative Christianity in shaping some anti-mask sentiment. In both cases I argue that attending to the Christian cultural politics which were obscured by dominant news frames can help us better understand the persistent role of religion in shaping public discourse.},

In this paper, I consider the mirrored boundaries between wakefulness/sleep and life/death, probing their psycho-existential and ontological infrastructures. I argue that these states of being are tethered, however tenuously, to each other and in doing so, clarify the stakes of the ostensibly quotidian and mundane. By analyzing insomnia, slumber, fever dreams and nightmares, the text reveals the literal and metaphorical coordinates that locate the bounds of Black consciousness and freedom. Black sleep becomes a kind of freedom, insofar as it offers reprieve that is only possible when the dreamwork is forgotten or psychically registered as nothing at all.},

In this regard, this essay speaks to religion not as a category of human experience, but instead as a kind of movement that sets our categories in default. Turning to scholars of religion like Charles Long and Black studies scholars like Sarah Jane Cervenak, I eventually suggest that Map offers us wandering as a method for studying religion; instead of coming with our received categories, I suggest, we must instead adopt wandering as a method; instead of starting with traditions, beliefs, theologies and histories, we should instead insist on life—and allow that insistence to guide our study.},

Taking a cue from Brian Richardson’s description of the second person as an “unnatural” register of narration, it explores Brand’s use of the second person as a voice of commingled alterity that has strong ethical implications for readers. With Brand’s analysis of “what sits in narrative” in An Autobiography of an Autobiography of Reading (2020) as a hermeneutic, the article demonstrates how, by blurring the gap between narratee and reader, Brand puts the reader “in the room with history.”},

Discussion between author and filmmaker throughout the research and writing process engages “visiting” as a methodology for studying Indigenous narrative arts.

	abstract = {Aesthesis is a political matter, such that black folk have often sought to challenge a mode of representation that mythologizes blackness as mere absence or lack. There is artmaking that seeks to transfigure both the void blackness is thought to represent and a known world whose “facts” depend on a fiction of black vacancy. These are works that, in the words of curator Adrienne Edwards, “are philosophically charged, culturally compounded abstractions” and figurations “that point to discourse beyond medium and art movements,” alternately affirming nothing or attuning to the indeterminacy and incalculability of blackness, whether blackness be attributed to person, place, or thing. Perception and its organization are meaningful and necessarily remain a ground of contestation. This essay concerns the refractive potentialities of blackness as well as its density or fullness that exceed the capture of mimetic representation. It highlights works that critically explore the received terms and limits of representation in the interest of the dissolution of given categories and conceptual forms. Focusing particular attention on Faith Ringgold’s Black Light and American People series, this essay both demonstrates that the aporia and paradoxical power that “black womanhood” has come to represent is pivotal in mediating the relation between abstraction and figuration in modern art and our social worlds as well as considers related works that reposition blackness as incalculable density and a light source in its own right.},

Dionne Brand’s A Map to the Door of No Return: Notes to Belonging (2001) draws us towards the uncharted/able expanse of the Door of No Return, and particularly the ways the Door overwhelms temporal senses and experiences. The Door, Brand describes, is a passport from a territory so vast that “[w]e are always in the middle of the journey” (Brand 2001, 49)., Map invites us not only to consider the inadequacies of origins and nation-state boundaries. Map also theorizes the inability of normative temporal schemas to render sensible the “past’s” ongoing presence in Black life in the wake(s) of the Door and the Middle Passage of racial slavery. Mirroring Brand’s weaving of personal narrative and theory, this reflection turns to the relationship between forgetting and time, particularly in intergenerational conversations, to understand how the Door disorients normative logics of time as a dimension of Black psychic life that people share in. In doing so, this reflection sits with how Map names a temporality of the Door that is not about fantastical change or transformation, but about continuous arrivals to the experience of a suspension that one never quite leaves.},

But Black life also unsettles the practices of cartography; indeed the maps that we have are political maps that are generated out of colonial desires.},

	abstract = {This paper considers Dionne Brand’s A Map to the Door of No Return: Notes to Belonging, arguing that the text theorizes the gulf between Blackness and the World as rooted in the question of affective experience. I read Brand’s deployment of the concept-metaphor of “the Door” and its attendant “tear in the world” as indexing the chasm from which Black feeling outside of and against “the World” as relational container irrupts. Brand’s text reveals that rather than offering an escape from meaning-as-capture, when considered from the position of Blackness, feeling is capture, and it is this seemingly paradoxical state of things that renders Black affect aporetic. Feeling-as-capture is antithetical to dominant theorizations which posit that the ontology of affect is escape. By theorizing capture as endemic to Blackness and therefore at the root of Black sensorial experience, Brand locates a rift in the very structure of affect.},

I stage a collision between notes and dreams, two of A Map to the Door of No Return’s many literary contours, in order to accentuate the author’s powerful critique of the romantic and violent assumptions of belonging. Brand’s deposition, where dreams constitute evidence, is not so much an undoing of historical violence—an impossibility—as it is a psychic undoing, hesitantly redirected back to the text’s unstable “I.” Approaching the enforced collectivity of Canadian nationalism, I close by locating A Map to the Door of No Return in a local context.},

	abstract = {In “Pinery Road \& Concession 11”, writer, academic and musician Leanne Betasamosake Simpson reflects on the chapter of the same name in Dionne Brand’s A Map to the Door of No Return. By physically traveling to the same corner in rural Ontario that Brand’s car broke down two decades earlier, Simpson considers place, belonging, diaspora, property, and foreclosure in her own Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg homeland. Simpson’s companion on part of the journey is an 80 year old Black Ash Basket which she repatriates to Curve Lake First Nation on the way. What follows is the text of the piece originally presented at the Map to the Door At 20 gathering. Simpson presented the piece over looped time lapse photography of the journey and surveillance footage of the intersection of Pinery Road \& Concession 11. Simpson’s sister, Ansley Simpson provided a soundscape for the piece, repurposed from Leanne’s track “Solidification” (Noopiming Sessions, Giizhiwe Music, 2021). “Pinery Road \& Concession 11” is an honour song to Brand’s constellation of thought that has traveled the world, and back to the Burnt River, near Kinmount, Ontario.},
